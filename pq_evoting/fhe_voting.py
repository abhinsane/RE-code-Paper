"""
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Voting Module
==============
Uses TenSEAL's BFV (Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren) scheme for encrypted vote
tallying.  Votes are **never decrypted during accumulation** — only the
election authority can reveal the final tally after the polls close.

Architecture
------------
* **FHEAuthority** – holds the BFV secret key; sets up the context and
  exports a *public* context for voters.
* **FHEVoter** – uses only the public context to encrypt individual votes
  as one-hot vectors.
* **FHETally** – homomorphically sums all encrypted vote vectors; the
  authority decrypts once at the end.

One-Hot Encoding
----------------
A vote for candidate *i* out of *n* candidates is encoded as::

    [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]   (1 at position i, 0 elsewhere)

Homomorphic addition of one-hot vectors gives the per-candidate tally
directly — no intermediate decryption is needed.

Security Parameters (BFV)
--------------------------
* poly_modulus_degree = 16384  (≥128-bit post-quantum security, NIST recommended)
* plain_modulus = 786 433      (prime, satisfies BFV constraints for degree=16384)

class ShardedFHETally:

    Unlimited-scale homomorphic vote accumulator.

    BFV ciphertext noise grows with each homomorphic addition, capping a plain
    FHETally at roughly FHE_POLY_MOD_DEGREE / 5 votes.  ShardedFHETally
    avoids this ceiling by splitting the vote stream into *shards* of at most
    ``shard_size`` votes each.  Every shard is a separate FHETally.  At
    :meth:`finalize` each shard is decrypted independently and the resulting
    integer counts are summed — no noise accumulates across shard boundaries.

    This approach trades a constant number of extra FHE decryptions (one per
    shard) for unlimited voter scale.  Each decryption happens only after the
    polls close, so vote secrecy is unaffected.
